It's been a while since I started the set of posts about porting CPython modules to IronPython. I still plan on coming back to this set of posts and show how I continue porting the library, things have just been VERY crazy at work lately and I've had to spend a lot of my at home time working. Needless to say, this is not the optimal solution and things should be quieting down a bit in the next few weeks. I promise I'll come back and continue with the posts. You have my word!
