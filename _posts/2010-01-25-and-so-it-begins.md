Tomorrow I start into my healthy kick again. I know that sounds kind of like an arbitrary day to start, but for the past two weeks we've had some people visiting our site from Germany, and we've taken them out and shown them to some good restaurants. Yes, another excuse, but no longer! I am going to get back into the habit of using my BodyBugg and entering my food consumption on the website. I hope to be back down around my low by summer time and I hope to stay there instead of going back up. Wish me luck.
