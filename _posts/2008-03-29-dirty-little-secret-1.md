To start of my "Dirty Little Secret" series of music blogs, I'll start out with a real kicker. 

Kelly Clarkson - Since U Been Gone

Oh, why, oh why do I like this song?! Many times my dirty little secret songs are not clear to me why I like them. This song is no different. It combines several things that I normally do not like. 

 1. Kelly Clarkson
 2. Kelly Clarkson
 3. <del>Teeny Bop Music</del> Kelly Clarkson

As you can tell, I am not a fan of Kelly Clarkson at all. I don't like American Idol (shock!) and anyone to come from American Idol is a marketing ploy at best. Which is why it shames me to say that I love this song. One redeeming quality of this song is that it was written by Avril Lavigne who is a somewhat better musician than Kelly Clarkson.

I can't tell you why I like this song; it does shame me to say I do.

Embedding was disabled on this one, so you'll have to click [here][1] to see the video.

Please leave comments on why I should be ashamed for liking this song, or about songs you have that are your dirty little secrets. I'll continue with another winner next time.
