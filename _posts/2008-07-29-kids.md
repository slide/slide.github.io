>A couple people that I have reconnected with on Facebook have asked for some pictures of my kids. So, since I think my kids are pretty much the cutest (and what self respecting father doesn&#8217;t?! the only difference in this case is that I am right&#8230;buahahahahah!)

  This is one of my favorite pictures of my daughter. She looks so completely innocent that it makes me smile. Then you add the puppy face makeup on top of it, and there just isn&#8217;t anything more I can say. She got this face paint do-up at the open house we had when the market didn&#8217;t suck as much as it does now (it still sucked then too though). We had a couple people come look at the house, but I think this picture might be the highlight for me&#8230;oh&#8230;and the AWESOME florescent green with gold faux overcoat paint job in our bedroom. I didn&#8217;t sleep well for several weeks.

  This is the Girl in all her Joy School Graduation glory. She was smiling to humor me I&#8217;m sure, as she would have much rather been outside playing with her school mates. She did great during her program, she kept an eye on the boy who was rubbing his eyes the ENTIRE time during singing. Afterwards, she asked &#8220;Why was so-and-so rubbing his eyes during all the songs?&#8221; I didn&#8217;t have a good answer, but at least she made sure he was ok and didn&#8217;t let the singing interrupt her watching him.

  No, my boy is not staring at the wall. What you can&#8217;t see is the television that is in the little alcove not 2 feet in front of him (ok, more like three or four). His favorite spot for television is one of two places: as close as he can get physically to the television, or tucked nicely in next to me on the sofa. I prefer that latter.

  Slide-o-Wife made this outfit for my boy from a button up shirt she found at the DI. I&#8217;ve been trying to convince her she should sell them based on the number of comments I&#8217;ve gotten at church from various mothers as to how they wished they had one. I haven&#8217;t had success yet. The wheelbarrow in the background sat in that position for roughly 8 months after my wonderful wife went out and did some weeding for the first time ever in her life (j/k). I piled more weeds on it about a month after this picture was taken and then finally disposed of it all when half of it blew around the yard during a storm. Sweet.
