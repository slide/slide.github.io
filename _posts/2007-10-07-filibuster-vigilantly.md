The title of this post really has nothing to do with what it is about. It comes from a song by They Might Be Giants named "Birdhouse In Your Soul" if you are interested. It seems from my googling of it, that this is a somewhat popular blog entry title.

I've started reading a book called [Getting Things Done][1] by David Allen in hopes of improving my efficiency and productivity. I figure the more I can get done in a more efficient time period, the more time I will have to spend with my family. The interesting thing about this book so far (I'm only on page 5) is the way that Mr. Allen refers to work. I tend to separate my life into work and home, Mr. Allen tends to say that anything that needs to be done is work, and his system will cover all "work." I really like this.

Whether it is mowing the lawn or finishing the power measurements at the office, these are things in my life that need to be completed. They are work items, that if I can plan for better, I hope to complete more efficiently and have more time with my wonderful family. Every minute that this program buys me with my family is a great return on any investment in my time it takes to learn the program.
