If you remember [this post][1], I was hoping to be back down around my low point by the summer. That didn&#8217;t happen. Not even close. I am up, up, up. It&#8217;s been interesting this time going back up, because I&#8217;ve noticed my increase in weight, and I can actually feel the extra weight on this time. Something I had never noticed before when I regained lost weight. I&#8217;m not sure what the difference is this time. Perhaps it&#8217;s because I got lower than I was even in high school so the change was more dramatic, I don&#8217;t know. I would really like to get back down there, it felt great. I felt the best I have ever felt. My back didn&#8217;t hurt as much, I slept better, all around just a better feel day in and day out. So, wish me luck as I try again to embark upon the downward path.
