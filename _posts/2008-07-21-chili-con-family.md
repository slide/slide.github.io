My family has been out of town for nearly a week (Tuesday). When my family is out of town that usually means I stay up REALLY late writing code, browsing the web and general geekery. This time has been completely different. I&#8217;ve stayed up REALLY REALLY late writing code, browsing the web and general geekery. 

I miss my family quite a bit. It&#8217;s the small things that really get to me and make me into a sappy dork (which I don&#8217;t mind). I miss when my wife wakes up just a little bit when I am leaving and says &#8220;I love you&#8221; in her sleepy voice, and then falling right back to sleep like it never happened. I miss my daughter wanting to type her name on my computer. I miss my son getting so excited when I get home that he shakes a little bit. My wife is the noticer and rememberer in the family (she can remember outfits she wore when she was three, I have a hard time remembering what I wore yesterday without looking in the dirty clothes hamper), and it&#8217;s not until I don&#8217;t have something that I realize how much I notice and how much comfort it brings me.

My wife would insert a comment on how sappy I am&#8230;I miss the way she makes fun of me&#8230; <img src='https://earl-of-code.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> 

This coming week I am committing myself to running again. I used to run 6 miles a day (3 in the morning and 3 at night) and I actually really enjoyed it. It&#8217;s hard to start back up again after 3 years of not doing it though. I can often find rationalizations for not going out, but once I&#8217;m out and hit my stride, I do like it.

The [intervals program][1] I did a couple weeks ago was pretty good as well. It is supposed to increase the amount of oxygen your body can process, and increase your speed over all. I liked the results (and the workout I got from it) when I did it and need to get back doing it.
