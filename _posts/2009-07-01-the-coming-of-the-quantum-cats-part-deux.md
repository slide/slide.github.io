So, originally I was going to post on every chapter of this book. It was a really quick read (I finished it a couple weeks ago). I&#8217;ve been pondering what to write. I liked the book. I didn&#8217;t love the book. It jumped around a lot between a couple different viewpoints. Basically, we get to know the same character from a couple different universes. I really liked how different the three versions of the same person were. Depending on the history of their world, they turned out remarkably different.

One of them was a low level mortgage broker, another was a high level scientist and the last was a US Senator. They didn&#8217;t talk about where each one&#8217;s history differed to get to the point they were at, but it was interesting to see.

I don&#8217;t know if I would recommend this book to anyone, but if you want to borrow it I think I still have it.
