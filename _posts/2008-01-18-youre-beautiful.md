This post is about James Blunt&#8217;s &#8220;You&#8217;re Beautiful&#8221;

My wife turned me on to this song. She hears things on the radio, or on TV and asks me to find them for her. At first, I really didn&#8217;t like this song, but as with many songs that I don&#8217;t like at first, as I listened to it more I found things that I really liked about it.

  * The clean guitar that starts it all out is fantastic. I love the riff and how it melds in with the background stuff that is going on.
  * I love how parts of this song almost feel like they don&#8217;t fit, but then they do. Near the end when he sings &#8220;There must be angel with a smile on her face, when she thought up that I should be with you&#8221; it *almost* doesn&#8217;t fit with the rest of the song. It&#8217;s saving grace to me is the rhythm he sings the second part in
  * This song fits into my guilty pleasure arena with it&#8217;s &#8220;cheesy&#8221; nature, but it seems to do it with a lot of depth. It&#8217;s the same old story of someone seeing someone and falling in love but knowing they will never be with that person, but in this case I think it&#8217;s done a bit more classy than the 80&#8242;s butt rock that used this theme very often.

Apparently, as you can see in this next video. James Blunt likes to be alone in weird places, doing weird things. In &#8220;You&#8217;re Beautiful&#8221; he is alone and taking off his clothes in a very cold place. In this one he is alone in a weird room sitting in a chair singing to no one and running through the woods by himself. An odd man.
