System of a Down &#8211; Chop Suey!

Another one in the System of a Down series.

I just really dig a lot of System of a Down stuff. I dig the harmonies, the different guitar sounds in the same song (hard and soft riffs), and I dig **some** of the subject matter. 

Why I like this song: 

  * The guitar riff at the beginning has the sound of a good Spanish-in-your-face dance number, then grows with the drums into a driving force of pure joy.
  * I once played this song for a co-worker who is 20 years older, he asked me when it came to the heaviest sections &#8220;What&#8217;s the point?!&#8221; Referring to what he thought was the lack of musicality or lyric nature of those parts. My take on them is that they provide a distinct antithesis to the lyrical parts of the song. When he then goes into the &#8220;trust in my self righteous suicide&#8221; portion, the distinction is rather clear between that and the driving parts.
  * As with most System of a Down songs, I really enjoy the harmonies on this song. They fit well with the background and kind of pump me up.
</ul> 

I found this really cool Lego version of the music video on YouTube and couldn&#8217;t resist. Enjoy!
