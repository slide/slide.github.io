While driving to work one day, my brother (who I carpool with) pointed out a sign that read.

&#8220;Vote Schmuck&#8230;That&#8217;s Right! Frank Schmuck&#8221;.

I laughed out loud for several minutes and made several jokes with my brother (&#8220;They let any schmuck run for office these days&#8221;, &#8220;Boy, another schmuck in office&#8230;what&#8217;s so new about that?&#8221; and so on and so forth). Then I began to realize how genius the ad campaign is. How many more people will remember a sign for a guy with the last name Schmuck?! It seems to me that if you have a last name like Schmuck, you&#8217;ve got to use it to your advantage. 

On, Mr. Schmuck&#8217;s [website][2] there is a note about the origin of the name Schmuck (German for jewel or jewelry&#8230;which makes me wonder how it got the negative conotation it has in the US). This lead me to wikipedia, where I found the following [article][3] explaining how schmuck came into the English language from Yiddish. (Yiddish is a cool word by the way). 

Anyway, I don&#8217;t know much about Mr. Schmuck in terms of his positions on issues, nor do I live in his voting district, but he has my support purely on the merits of his ingenious play on his last name.
