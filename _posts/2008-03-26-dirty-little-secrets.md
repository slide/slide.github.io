I&#8217;m going to be taking my music exploration into a little different direction. I know everyone has these, they don&#8217;t want to tell their friends, their significant other, their family, or even their dog; they love those songs that they &#8220;shouldn&#8217;t&#8221;. These are what I call my dirty little secrets. Songs that I love and can listen to over and over, but have no depth, sometimes very little musicality and sometimes are so cheesy you could make nachos. Over the next couple of posts, I will be introducing you to a few of my dirty little secrets; putting them out there for the mockery and shame that should be mine for liking them. You be the judge, shame me, mock me, do whatever you like, but I will always hold these dirty little secrets in high regard. If you&#8217;re brave enough, maybe you&#8217;ll comment with some of your dirty little secrets too.
