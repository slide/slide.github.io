I saw [this link][1] on Digg that said &#8220;Neil Young sings &#8216;Fresh Prince&#8217;&#8221; (or something similar) and was instantly hooked. I love covers, especially when someone completely outside the genre of the original does the cover. Johhny Cash singing &#8220;Rusty Cage&#8221; by Soundgarden? 

  
  
  
Love it.   
  
Me First and Gimme Gimmes doing &#8220;100 Miles&#8221; by the Proclaimers? Awesome. (Couldn&#8217;t find a video of this one).  
  
  
[Matt Weddle singing &#8220;Hey Ya&#8221; by Outkast?

Great.  
  
  
I don&#8217;t know what it is about covers, I just like to see other takes on a piece of music. Generally, if the musician doing the cover is good at what they do, they put their own style onto it and I get to hear something that is sometimes completely different from the original, but still holds the essence of that original.

Here&#8217;s the video of the Fresh Prince cover.
