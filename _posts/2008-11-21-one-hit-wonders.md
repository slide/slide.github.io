I often find a song from a band that I really, really like. The problem is, I think to myself, &#8220;Gee, if I like this song, I will probably like more of their songs.&#8221; Most of the time I am sadly disappointed.

Let&#8217;s look at a few examples:

**1. The Redwalls &#8211; Summer Romance**

Sadly, this is the best video I could find on YouTube&#8230;doesn&#8217;t do the song justice.   


I can listen to this song over and over. To me, it sounds like something that The Beatles would have put together. The slow build, rowdy interlude and back to the slow melodic verses. I really, really like this song. So, again, I thought to myself, &#8220;I have to check out the rest of their stuff, it&#8217;s probably just as awesome!&#8221; WRONG. I couldn&#8217;t find another song by them that I liked. Perhaps I didn&#8217;t give them enough of a shot; perhaps I was asking for too much out of them, and maybe I&#8217;ll check them out again. I put them on my list of one hit wonders; bands that I can only find one song I like.

**2. Avenged Sevenfold &#8211; Seize the Day**



The first thing I have to mention about this is the part of the video where the guy starts into his guitar solo on top of the coffin. CLASSY. I want someone to do a guitar solo on top of my coffin when I die. That would be awesome. Back to the song.

This song has a certain raw quality to it that I really like. The lead singer&#8217;s voice is both melodic and raw at the same time. The guitar solo in the middle has a great sound to it and I like the speed change in the middle. Again, I went looking for other songs by Avenged Sevenfold, didn&#8217;t find a single one that I could even listen to more than one time.

**3. M.I.A &#8211; Paper Planes**

I have a buddy who HATES this song, which might be part of the reason I like it so much. Actually, I really, really like the beat on this song, and I like the usage of the gunshots and cash register as percussive &#8220;instruments.&#8221; The lyrics are pretty much nonsense to me, but they are ok. It&#8217;s a good song to relax to, as the beat is nice and slow and doesn&#8217;t require a lot of thought. I listened to some of M.I.A.&#8217;s other stuff and thought it was crap, pure and utter crap.

I don&#8217;t know what it is that catches my fancy on some of these songs, they just inch their way into my head and I dig them. I wish I could find another band that I liked more than 3 or 4 of their songs (I like a majority of the Beatles), but I haven&#8217;t found a band like that yet.
