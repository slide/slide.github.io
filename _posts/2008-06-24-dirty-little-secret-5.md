This is another really really shameful song that I like. I just looked up the video for the first time today and it made me like this song even more. There are just those songs that you wonder what the crap makes you like them and this is one of them. I can seriously listen to this song over and over, much to the chagrin of my wife I am sure. 

I don't know that there is anything I can say to redeem myself from this song, so I leave it up to you, the reader to find one thing you like about this song. Just one little thing! 

Sadly, I can find many.
