[Serj Tankian][1] - Empty Walls

I really like [System of a Down][2]. The harmonies they use are awesome and the driving beat is cool too. They have a pretty wide variety of styles that they play, although heavier is definitely their style.

Serj Tankian is the lead singer of System of a Down. The band to a hiatus from making albums and Serj came out with a solo album. The first time I heard this song, I thought it was SOAD, but when I looked it up, it was Serj. You can tell who has a lot of artistic involvement in SOAD's songs. 

Why I like this song:

  * There are several different styles: soft melodic, hard driving, crazy sounding lyrics and more!
  * Serj's voice is perfect for the type of music he sings. He has some hard edges, but underneath is a good set of pipes.
  * The harmonies in this song are great. The background singers seem to take the place of the second singer in SOAD pretty well, although nothing can really replace the harmonies he and Serj sing in [Lonely Day][3]
  * This song is great to code to, it doesn't take a lot of thought to listen to in enjoyment mode (deep thought mode works with this song too, the message from this song, and the video is quite clear, something SOAD has lacked a little in their most recent popular songs).
