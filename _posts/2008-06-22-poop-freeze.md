I really hope the people who came up with this product make a lot of money off of it. I'm not saying that because I would ever buy some, nor would I ever probably use it. We don't generally take my dog on walks where he drops a load (nor are his loads that bad to deal with since he weighs a whole 4 pounds).

The sales pitch by the inventor must have gone something like this...

**Inventor:** "So, I have this product that will make it easier for dog owners to retrieve the dog waste while they are out on a walk. It will completely revolutionize taking your dog for a walk!"

**Company:** "Some sort of pole that you can carry to make it so you don't have to bend over? Maybe some sort of device to instantly desinigrate the feces so you don't have to deal with it at all?"

**Inventor:** "No, even better! It's a spray can that you spray the feces with to freeze it!"

**Company:** \*blank stare\*

**Inventor:** "Frozen feces will be much easier for people to get a handle on and the feeling is much better, no one likes picking up the warm feces from the ground."

**Company:** \*blank stare\*

**Inventor:** "The best part is the name I came up with, are you ready for this?! &#8216;Poop Freeze'!"

**Company:** \*blank stare\*
