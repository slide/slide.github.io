I really hope the people who came up with this product make a lot of money off of it. I&#8217;m not saying that because I would ever buy some, nor would I ever probably use it. We don&#8217;t generally take my dog on walks where he drops a load (nor are his loads that bad to deal with since he weighs a whole 4 pounds).

The sales pitch by the inventor must have gone something like this&#8230;

**Inventor:** &#8220;So, I have this product that will make it easier for dog owners to retrieve the dog waste while they are out on a walk. It will completely revolutionize taking your dog for a walk!&#8221;

**Company:** &#8220;Some sort of pole that you can carry to make it so you don&#8217;t have to bend over? Maybe some sort of device to instantly desinigrate the feces so you don&#8217;t have to deal with it at all?&#8221;

**Inventor:** &#8220;No, even better! It&#8217;s a spray can that you spray the feces with to freeze it!&#8221;

**Company:** \*blank stare\*

**Inventor:** &#8220;Frozen feces will be much easier for people to get a handle on and the feeling is much better, no one likes picking up the warm feces from the ground.&#8221;

**Company:** \*blank stare\*

**Inventor:** &#8220;The best part is the name I came up with, are you ready for this?! &#8216;Poop Freeze&#8217;!&#8221;

**Company:** \*blank stare\*
