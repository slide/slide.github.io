[Cinematic Orchestra][1] - To Build a Home

I don't remember where I first heard this song. I think it was linked on some music blog, but I thought it was one of the greatest songs I had ever heard. It reminded me of Coldplay before their second album (which I don't like by the way). The melody is fantastic and the lead singer's voice is perfect for this song. The simple piano under the voice, just emphasizes the simplicity of the first part of the song. I think I played this song so much that Wife doesn't like it much anymore, but I normally do that with any song that I really start liking. This is one of those songs that I can listen to over and over, and have done so on several occasions.

Why I like it: 

  * Starts out **very** simple, and builds to an awesome climax. The simplicity of the piano at the beginning, and then the addition of the strings as it goes along is awesome.
  * I am a sucker for piano and strings in rock/pop music.
  * The lyrics are not overdone. They are simple, to the point, yet deep. There are some good metaphors for life and stuff.
  * My favorite line in the whole song is &#8220;I climbed a tree to see the world.&#8221; I don't know why it is my favorite, but it is.

This is not an official video from the song, but I thought it was pretty good.
