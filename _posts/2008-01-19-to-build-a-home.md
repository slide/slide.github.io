[Cinematic Orchestra][1] &#8211; To Build a Home

I don&#8217;t remember where I first heard this song. I think it was linked on some music blog, but I thought it was one of the greatest songs I had ever heard. It reminded me of Coldplay before their second album (which I don&#8217;t like by the way). The melody is fantastic and the lead singer&#8217;s voice is perfect for this song. The simple piano under the voice, just emphasizes the simplicity of the first part of the song. I think I played this song so much that Wife doesn&#8217;t like it much anymore, but I normally do that with any song that I really start liking. This is one of those songs that I can listen to over and over, and have done so on several occasions.

Why I like it: 

  * Starts out **very** simple, and builds to an awesome climax. The simplicity of the piano at the beginning, and then the addition of the strings as it goes along is awesome.
  * I am a sucker for piano and strings in rock/pop music.
  * The lyrics are not overdone. They are simple, to the point, yet deep. There are some good metaphors for life and stuff.
  * My favorite line in the whole song is &#8220;I climbed a tree to see the world.&#8221; I don&#8217;t know why it is my favorite, but it is.
</ul> 

This is not an official video from the song, but I thought it was pretty good.
