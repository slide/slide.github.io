I go through spurts of time where I almost have to be listening to music for the creative coding juices to flow. A great coding song is one that can sit in the background, but provide a little bump now and then. Generally speaking, classical music is great for me to code to. I received the [Classical Thunder][1] CD set when I was back in high school doing a lot of music.

I&#8217;m getting a little bit ahead of myself, so let me give you a little background on music in my life.

Music plays an important role for me, I was originally a music education major when I started college (yes, only one semester though). When I was getting ready for junior high, we had the option of taking band, orchestra, choir, or something else that I don&#8217;t remember. I had done a minimal amount of singing in church stuff, but it didn&#8217;t really interest me, neither did orchestra and whatever that something else was that I can&#8217;t remember, it didn&#8217;t seem like something I would like either. Then there was band. Both of my siblings had done the band thing in junior high. My brother played the clarinet and my sister the trumpet. I don&#8217;t remember ever going to their concerts or hearing them practice, but something made me feel interested in band. The next decision was what instrument to choose. Clarinet didn&#8217;t seem interesting and neither did trumpet, but trombone, now there was an instrument! I wouldn&#8217;t have to worry about pressing keys!&nbsp;So, I put trombone down on my registration form.

I played trombone, with some success, through junior high. I played in the top groups at the school and was the lead chair in those groups. I don&#8217;t claim to have been great at all. I was probably more confident than the other trombone players in my group, so I put myself out there more and tried more things. My freshman year, I decided to get into marching band. I had a blast doing the summer parade band and decided I wanted to do the fall marching band as well, even though freshmen were at a different school from the sophomore through senior students. The fall marching band was a great time and I was starting to feel like music was what I wanted to do with my life.

High school was a whirlwind of music. I continued playing in the top groups and was invited to play in the full symphony my school had. I learned more about classical music that year than I had ever known before. I had often thought that classical music was just Beethoven and Bach, which I didn&#8217;t like at the time. My musical world was opened up to&nbsp;Tchaikovsky, Dvorak, Offenbach, Sibelius and others. My sophomore year, we played <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDFqsuJB1Xc" target="_blank">Tchaikovsky&#8217;s 5th Symphony Finale</a>&nbsp;which I still love. We did not play a watered down version of it, it was the same as in that video. I purchased a lot of classical music that year. I was also involved with the top concert band at the school, where I learned about famous march composers such as Sousa, Reed and others. I loved playing.

Fast forward to the end of my senior year. I was completing AP Music theory, playing in the Wind Symphony, Symphonic Orchestra, Jazz Ensemble, a second year drum major in the marching band and also the pep band. I was accepted at Utah State University into the Music Education program. I knew what I wanted to do with my life.

My first semester of college was an eye opener, as it is for many people. On the semester system, I had 11 classes at 17 credit hours. I was learning to play piano, clarinet, flute, percussion and playing in the marching band, regular band, jazz band 2 and in the trombone choir. I took private lessons from a great trombone instructor <a href="http://www.usu.edu/music/ensembles/jazz/USUJazz/ToddFallis.html" target="_blank">Dr. Todd Fallis</a>. I think that Dr. Fallis knew I was not really cut out for what I had chosen, but he didn&#8217;t let on, he worked hard with me on getting better.

After my first semester, I was exhausted and was not enjoying music very much. The love of playing was not there anymore and I could see that the other trombone players were a lot better than I was. I got started into my second semester one week and decided I needed to make a decision. I wasn&#8217;t enjoying the music anymore and didn&#8217;t want to do it, so I looked back on some of the other classes I had taken in high school to see what else I might be interested in. I had taken only one programming class in high school, which was AP Computer Science. That was the last year they taught the class using C++, so the credit from that would get me out of the first semester of CS classes and I had really enjoyed that class. So, I went in and switched majors from Music Education to Computer Science.

The amazing thing was that I had 18 credit hours, but only 6 classes! I actually had a life. I wasn&#8217;t constantly practicing or going to&nbsp;rehearsals&nbsp;and more importantly, I was enjoying music again. I continued in the CS major and received a BS with an emphasis in Digital Systems (I took some EE classes as part of the degree).&nbsp;I was really enjoying the classes and I was really enjoying music again. Music was still a big part of my life. My roommate was a big music person too and we shared bands and songs back and forth a lot, but it was no longer a burden.

Now that I&#8217;ve given the background on my history with music, in the next part I&#8217;ll actually get to some of the songs that I consider essential programming music. You may understand a bit more why I choose what I choose with the background info.
