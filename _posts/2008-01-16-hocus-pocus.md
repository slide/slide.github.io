In the coming weeks I will be highlighting some of the songs that I think are really cool, especially live. This week, we&#8217;ll be looking at a Dutch group from the early seventies called [Focus][1]. I haven&#8217;t heard anything else by them, ever. This is the only song that I have ever heard and I have to say, I even like this version better than the album version. The great things about this video are:

  1. The lead &#8220;singer&#8217;s&#8221; (I put it in quotes because he mainly just yodels, I don&#8217;t if that is officially singing in my book) facial expressions are great in comparison to the lackadaisical looks on the faces of the rest of the band.
  * This seems to be about 125% of the speed of the normal album cut, and yet, again the lackadaisical looks on the faces of the band members.
  * Overall, this song is just a great mix of different stuff. It&#8217;s got some Jethro Tull type stuff in there (obvious one with the flute), but it also has some stuff that reminds me of Deep Purple, and some other bands.
</ol> 

Take a listen (and watch it too, for pure entertainment value) and let me know what you think with a comment.
